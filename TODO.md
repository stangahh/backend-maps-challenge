# TODO

- [cleanAddress()](src/addresses.ts:28) Do a bunch of simple mapping to change the ugly Google Maps data structure into a strcture that is easier to consume for library authors.
  - Need a function for every type in enum [AddressTypes](node_modules@googlemaps\google-maps-services-js\dist\common.d.ts:815)
